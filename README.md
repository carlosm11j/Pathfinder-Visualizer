React web application to visually show different pathfinding algorithms

Users can:
- Choose a particular algorithm 
- Build walls that the algorithm cannot traverse through
- Pick start and end points for algorithm to find







Project is adapted from Clement Mihalisecu which can be found here https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial
